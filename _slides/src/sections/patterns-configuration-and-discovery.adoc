= Pattern #{counter:patterns}: Service discovery

****
In order to communicate with another service, a service needs to
know the other service’s address
****

== Intent

All solutions under _Service Discovery_ umbrella provide::

* mechanism	for	an	instance	to	register	itself
* they	provide	a way	to	find	the	service	once	it’s	registered

Service	discovery	gets	more	complicated, though,	when	we	are	considering	an	environment	where	we	are	constantly	destroying	and deploying	new	instances	of	services.

== Problem

****
Figure out where is the service +
I'd like to call

== Discussion

Simplest solutions::
* hardcode the physical address and port of all the services that a service needs to use
* have addresses and ports externalized into a configuration file provided at startup time

****
Both cases forces static deployment (no changes in the infrastructure) which contradicts microservices agility (a distributed monolith?)
****

== !

Realistic solution::
* location of services is provided indirectly (decoupled between the services through shared abstractions)

****
In microservicers environments services stay decoupled and mobile
****

== Structure

Client-Side Service Discovery::
* each service register itself in a central registry
* all services look up the information

== !

Server-Side Service Discovery::
* store the information on the load-balancer (AWS Elastic Load Balancing works that way)
* clients always call same address which encapsulate the dynamic changes of implementations

.Consistency vs. Availability
* All information are stored in a consistent fashion (placed in a single atomic store) - *consistency*
* Information are distributed in a peer-to-peer manner (eventual consistency) - *availability*

****
(...) it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.
****

== Example

Known implementations::
* Zookeeper
* Consul
* Eureka
