== Why miroservices?

* Better scaling (of people not solutions)
* Decentralizing decisions
* Frequent deployments
* Reduced local complexity
** What about overall complexity? But...

== Problems we had

* Builds which takes forever
* Deployments which takes forever
* Implementation of a features which takes forever
* MTTRF (mean time to resolve failure) damaging organization reputation
* Atomic releases, you need to wait until all features are complete to release
* In case of failure you rollback all changes, even these ones which worked

== Problems we have

* No-one completely grasp the whole solutions. But is it a bad thing?
* Mind-shift requiring *new operating model*
* When things goes wrong it first the *where* problem rather than *why*?
* Potential increase in latency

== Problems we have

.As described in literature
* Conway's law
* fallacies of distributed computing
* CAP (consistency, availability, partition tolerance) theorem

== Conway's Law

[quote ,M. Conway]
""
Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.
""

== CAP theorem, aka Brewer's theorem

[quote ,Wikipedia]
""
(...) it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.
""

=== CAP guarantees

[quote,Wikipedia]
""
Consistency:: every read receives the most recent write or an error

Availability:: every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information

Partition tolerance:: the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures

== Fallacies of distributed computing

[quote, Wikipedia]
""
(...) are a set of assertions made by L Peter Deutsch and others at Sun Microsystems describing false assumptions that programmers new to distributed applications invariably make

== list of fallacies

8 fallacies of distributed computing::
. The network is reliable.
. Latency is zero.
. Bandwidth is infinite.
. The network is secure.
. Topology doesn't change.
. There is one administrator.
. Transport cost is zero.
. The network is homogeneous.

== How are we solving it?

// TODO: rozwinąć te punkty np na bazie książki Bonera - Reactive_Microservices_Architecture

* Failure isolation - _bulkheading_
* Autonomous services - service promises its own behaviour by publishing
its protocol/API
* Single responsibility - encapsulate a single concept
* State ownership
* Asynchronous, message based communication
* Location transparency
